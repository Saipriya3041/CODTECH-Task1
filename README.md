Overview  of the Project
Project:LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES
Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like
square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the
Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.
Objective
 The primary goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate housing prices based on selected features, allowing stakeholders (like buyers, sellers, and real estate agents) to make informed decisions.
 Key Activities
 Data Acquisition:

Obtain a relevant housing dataset (e.g., Ames Housing dataset).
Ensure the dataset includes necessary features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Explore the Dataset: Understand the structure, types of data, and distributions of key features.
Handle Missing Values: Identify and address any missing data through imputation or removal.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for the model (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, location).
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate model performance.
Feature Engineering:

Normalization/Standardization: Scale features to improve model convergence and performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (like location) into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Model Training:

Initialize and fit the linear regression model using the training dataset.
Analyze model coefficients to understand feature impacts on housing prices.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict housing prices on the test dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared

Visualize predictions against actual values using scatter plots or residual plots.

Model Interpretation:
Interpret the model coefficients to understand the relationship between features and housing prices.
Discuss the implications of findings for stakeholders in the real estate market.

Reporting and Visualization:
Prepare visualizations to communicate results, including:
Histograms of predicted vs. actual prices.
Coefficient plots for feature importance.
Compile insights into a report or presentation for stakeholders.

Iterate and Refine:
Based on evaluation results, consider refining the model:
Experiment with additional features.
Use regularization techniques if needed (e.g., Ridge or Lasso regression).
Explore polynomial or interaction terms for non-linear relationships.
